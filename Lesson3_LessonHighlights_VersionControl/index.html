            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control is one main repository or storage space for all files and has become very popular because it allows multiple people to edit a file while never overwriting the original file. This is useful because at an moment a user can revert back to the original file, compare changes etc. In many instances users have lost a file with the click of one button and completely had to start over from scratch however version control makes lost files easily recoverable making life less stressful. Version control also makes it very simple for multiple people to work on one project and combine all files into one finished product in the end.</p>

            <p class="lead">Git is a free source used by many in professionals in the technology fields. It makes it easy for all members of a team to access projects from any computer. Also it gives users a backup place to save important projects on just in case a computer malfunctions or something happens to the file.It prevents overwrite and is a very simple and fastdatabase to use. Every time files are pushed to Git, it saves asnapshot of that file in that stage of the project to ensure it captures every change and exactly when it was made. .</p>

            <p class="lead">
                A version control system is a system specifically made to record changes made to a file. It goes into great detail about files including what was changed, who changed it , time and computer it was changed on and it will tell you exactly what is different about the new file.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead"> A remote repository is usually found on a server and is used in an office space by all employees sharing files in one place. It is not specific to one individual and can be found on the internet, company computer etc. A local repository is one specific to an individual that may be on a personal computer and stores all of their files in one place. Only the individual can access the files on a local repository.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git push is one of the most important commands when using git hub because it pushed files from the local repository to the remote repository making sure all changes have been updated and saved. It makes your branch the new go to on the remote repository meaning anyone who tires to clone that repository they will get what was committed eand all snapshots. This command is also very important because it makes files accessible from any computer and is an extra save in case anything happens to the original files. only problem is that if someone else pushes a copy of your file after changin it , git hub will not allow you to push your files again untill you have the most updated version</p>
